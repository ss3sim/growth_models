# Hake estimation model

TODO - add a brief description

A work in progress (probably doesn't run yet).

Notes:

- `starter.ss` is set up
- working on `.ctl` file now
- I set the `recdev phase` to 3; no idea if this is appropriate
- I set `F_Method` to 3
- I added `4  # N iterations for tuning F in hybrid method (recommend 3 to 7)`
- I haven't changed any estimation settings yet; what needs to be done?
- Which parameters do we want to estimate by default? And what is our strategy for assigning phases?
