### This folder contains model files and case files when using the age-based selectivity and maturity (instead of length-based) through [ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim) package.

### This should be the models to start with for ALL groups (and then modify as needed)

## Specific changes: 
- 1. Age based selectivity (using double normal but parametrized to mimic a logistic curve) (**NEED to do**)
- 2. Age based logistic maturity (last changed 10/27)
- 3. Years span from 1:100 (last changed 10/27)
- 4. Wider bounds for EM models (based on Kelli's approach: lower bounds = 0.5% of init values, upper bounds = 500% of init values) (last changed 10/27)
- 5. Changed the "F" case files to reflect the pop dyn of these new models (**NEED to do**)
